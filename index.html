			<p><strong>What does being married mean to you?</strong><br /> It means trusting your life with someone else. Trusting and sharing, no more independent. It's a friendship that you promise to make work forever.<br /><br /><strong>What's the most outrageous thing you've ever done?</strong><br /> Probably Tough Mudder, with the freezing water you have to plunge into and the electric shock field you have to run through.<br /><br /><strong>If you were stranded on a desert island what 3 things wo</strong><b>uld you bring with you and why?</b><br />My best friend -- although she'd be pissed at me for it! If she doesn't count then I would bring a big book, like the Bible or the dictionary, since I had all the time in the world to read. A blanket because I'd probably get cold and bug spray because God knows what insects I would come across.<br /><br /><strong>Describe your idea of the ultimate date.<br /></strong>Something outdoors and active, whether it was a sporting event or a trail hike.<br /><br /><strong>If you wanted</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>really impress a man, what would you do and why</strong><strong>?</strong><br />I'd probably cook him dinner because men are always impressed with my food.</p>

			<p><strong>What is your greatest achievement to date?</strong><br /> I would have to say that my independence is my greatest achievement.<br /><br /><strong>Do you like being the center of attention or do you prefer being more mysterious, and why?<br /></strong>I prefer to be more mysterious. It's best to leave some things to the imagination.<br /><br /><strong>What's the most romantic present you have ever received and why?<br /></strong>A kitten, because I love cats.<br /><br /><strong>What is your ideal mate's personality like</strong><b>?</b><br />Funny, smart and outgoing. Adventurous with a healthy amount of curiosity.<br /><br /><strong>What do you hope to get out of participating in this television show?</strong><br /> I really want to meet someone I could spend my life with. I know this isn't the most traditional way of doing this, but I think that the kind of love I am searching for isn't something that's easy to find, so I am open to all options.</p>
