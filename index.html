First was working at Sally Hershberger, next was making the NY Jets Flight Crew, then it was signing with Wilhelmina Models.<br><br><strong>If you could have lunch with three people, living or dead, who would it be?</strong><br>Joan Rivers, Will Farrell, and Cleopatra.<br><br><strong>Do you prefer a man who wants to be pursued or a man who pursues you?</strong><br>I like someone who knows what he wants. A challenge is fun, but there's a certain attractiveness to a man who's after me but knows when to pull back to allow room for my pursuit. Balance. :)<br><br><strong>What does being married mean to you?</strong><br>Lifetime, life partner, other half.
