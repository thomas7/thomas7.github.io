But I definitely do not mind a ski/snowboarding weekend trip here or there.</p> <p><strong>What is your favorite childhood memory? </strong>Family vacations. We always took a special trip once a year. One time we chartered a sailboat with a captain around the British Virgin Island for 10 days. We lived on the boat, ate, slept, showered, etc. It was an amazing experience. The Top 20 Beatles album will forever remind me of that trip.</p> <p><strong>What is your all-time favorite book and why? </strong>Honestly, I don’t love to read, but I did enjoy reading the first 150 pages or <em>50 Shades of Grey.</em> Then I just saw the movie.</p> <p><strong>If you could be any fruit or vegetable, which one would it be? </strong>I would say a banana. I have a protective outer skin, but quickly I become very easy to talk to and get to know. I’m very sweet and mix well with many things/types of people. And at times I can be “mushy” when I really love someone.</p> <p><strong>If you wanted to approach a man you had never met before, how would you go about it? </strong>I would probably go right up to him and just be myself. Maybe crack a corny joke, laugh at myself and ask him his name.</p> <p><strong>What is the most romantic present you have ever received and why? </strong>A journal with handwritten entries from every day of our vacation Europe together. It was cool to look back and read on the memories and how he was feeling each day.</p> <p><strong>Where do you see yourself in 5 years? </strong>In five years, I see myself living in a city I have never lived, hopefully with a man I love dearly, with a job I enjoy – preferably my own graphic design studio designing wedding/event invitations.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>                                    </div>

If I'm feeling social, then dinner/cocktails with girlfriends, but if I'm feeling lazy, then kitten cuddles, popcorn and movies with my sister.

It'd be quite the trio! I'd order pizza.</p> <p><strong>What is the most outrageous thing you've ever done?</strong> Probably skydiving.

I was right.</p> <p><strong>If you could be someone else for just one day, who would it be and why?</strong> The future me. I like my life and I'd love to see a glimpse of what's in store for me later in life. I would hope a nice husband and an army of children.</p> <p><strong>What is the most romantic present you have ever received and why?</strong> A huge painting of a lighthouse over the ocean. The man that gave it to me spent 80+ hours painting it.
